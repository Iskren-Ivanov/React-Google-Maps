# React-Google-Maps
The React Google Maps app integrates the Google Maps API to authenticate users and manage a collection of favorite locations. Users can add, edit and remove their favorite places and have the flexibility to sort them by name or alphabetical description. The app also offers a category-based filtering system. Please note that granting location permissions is critical for the app to work effectively.
